# Day Scheduler


## Description
Dynamic day scheduler app that allows users to enter and save tasks for the work day. The app is color-coded by time, so the user knows if a time slot or task is in the past, present, or future.

## Usage  
To use this repo, user should be comfortable using JavaScript and jQuery for DOM manipulation. Bootstrap was used for most of the styling with some minor tweaks, like the buttons and different color text areas, customized with a CSS file. All the time slots could be hard-coded into the HTML, but for this project they were dynamically created.
